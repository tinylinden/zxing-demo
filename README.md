## Motivation

I just wanted to check how complicated would it be to extract text from
[QR codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code) placed on PDF documents.

It turned out to be quite simple with help of:
 - [Apache PDFBoxÂ®](https://pdfbox.apache.org/) - library for working with PDF documents,
 - [ZXing](https://github.com/zxing/zxing) - library for barcode images processing.
